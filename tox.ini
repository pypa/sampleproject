#     confirm items checked into vcs are in your sdist
#  - python setup.py check 
#     confirm required package meta-data in setup.py
#  - readme_renderer (when using a ReStructuredText README)
#     confirms your long_description will render correctly on PyPI.
#
#  and also to help confirm pull requests to this project.
